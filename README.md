Implementation of Linear Regression Model!  

Welcome to this repository! Here, I implemented a simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn to analyze a dataset, evaluate model performance, and visualize results.  

Steps in the project  

🚀 Import and preprocess the dataset  
Data is loaded and cleaned to ensure it is ready for modeling. Missing values are handled, and necessary transformations are applied.  

📊 Split data into train-test sets  
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model effectively.  

📈 Fit a Linear Regression model  
Using the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model, we train a model to learn the relationship between features and target values.  

🧐 Evaluate model performance  
Key metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) are computed to assess how well the model performs.  

🎨 Plot regression line and interpret coefficients  
A visualization of the regression line is generated to understand how the model fits the data. The coefficients help explain the impact of each feature on the prediction.
